## 3. ABOUT — Identity Without Corporate Fluff

**Section heading:**
About Riza

**Short intro paragraph (2–3 sentences):**
I’m a full‑stack developer who likes turning messy requirements into clean, shippable products. Most of my work lives in dashboards, multi‑site systems, automation flows, and AI‑powered assistants that quietly do the boring parts for humans. I care about reliable deployments, clear UX, and code that future‑me won’t hate.

**One‑liner identity note:**
Developer by trade, automation addict by choice, semi‑functional human outside working hours.

**Trivia line:**
My debug process starts with questioning life choices, then opening the logs.
